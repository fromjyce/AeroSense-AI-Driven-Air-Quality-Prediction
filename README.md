# **AQI Prediction & Forecasting Web Application**

Welcome to the **AeroSense-AI-Driven-Air-Quality-Prediction** ‚Äì a  intuitive, and interactive tool for predicting, monitoring, and simulating AQI across Indian cities and stations in real-time. Leveraging  machine learning models, deep learning techniques, and time-series forecasting, this application offers users a comprehensive view of both present and future air quality, empowering individuals and policymakers with actionable insights.

## **Features Overview**

### **AQI Prediction**
Predict air quality for any city or station with just a few clicks! Our application uses advanced **time-series models** to generate pollutant concentration predictions, which are then processed through a deep learning network to compute AQI as per **CPCB AQI calculation rules**. Users can easily:

- Select a city or station.
- Specify a future date and time.
- Get immediate predictions for air quality based on pollutant concentration forecasts.

### üìä **Real-time AQI Monitoring**
Access real-time air quality data across **12 major metro cities in India** along with an overview of the entire nation. The dashboard helps you:

- View current AQI levels.
- Compare air quality between cities.
- Get an at-a-glance view of the nation‚Äôs overall air quality condition.

### üåç **AQI Forecasting**
Track AQI trends with predictions for **4 days prior** and **4 days ahead** of any selected date. This forecasting tool allows users to analyze air quality patterns and prepare for potential environmental changes by:

- Exploring historical data.
- Viewing future air quality forecasts.
- Making informed decisions based on air quality trends.

### üå™Ô∏è **AR AQI Simulator**
Simulate AQI outcomes by adjusting various environmental variables! Users can input dynamic factors such as **wind, sunlight, temperature, rain, cars on the road, electric vehicles, and power plants** to visualize their influence on AQI over time, offering insights into the factors driving pollution levels.

### üå¶Ô∏è **Weather Integration**
Stay updated on weather conditions alongside AQI data. This dashboard includes weather-related information, including:

- Current **temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed**.
- **5-day weather forecast**, helping users make informed choices based on both weather and air quality.

### üí° **AI-Driven Insights and Suggestions**
Our AI tool leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to provide personalized insights and recommendations based on AQI forecasts. The AI suggests actions to mitigate pollution (e.g., use of electric vehicles, planting trees) and answers queries about:

- Environmental policies.
- Health implications of AQI.
- Strategies for reducing pollution.

### ü§ñ **Air Quality Prediction Model using LSTM Neural Networks**
We employ **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks** for time-series forecasting of air quality. Our model is designed to:

- Predict future AQI values based on historical pollutant data.
- Analyze data from multiple air quality stations (PM2.5, NO2, CO, SO2, O3, and more).
- Incorporate **temporal features** like day, month, hour, and minute for improved predictions.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React.js)
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, LSTM Neural Networks
- **Data Handling & Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **APIs:** Integration with real-time AQI data APIs and weather APIs
- **Cloud Services:** AWS or GCP (for deployment)
- **Visualization Tools:** Plotly, D3.js (for interactive graphs and simulations)

## **How it Works**

1. **Data Collection:** The system continuously fetches real-time AQI data from monitoring stations and weather information through APIs.
2. **Preprocessing:** The data undergoes rigorous preprocessing, including **feature scaling, sequence creation**, and **station-specific** handling.
3. **Prediction:** Using **LSTM models**, pollutant concentrations are forecasted, followed by deep learning-based AQI calculation.
4. **Interactive UI:** Users interact with a simple yet powerful interface to select cities, dates, and prediction parameters.
5. **Simulation:** Input variables like temperature, wind, and vehicle count, and see their impact on AQI in real-time.
